        <h2>About Dilophosaurs</h2>
        <p>
            Dilophosaurs is a type of dinosours animal that lived in what is now North America during the Early
            Jurassic, about 186 million years ago.
            The Dilophosaurus got its scientific name Dilophosaurus wetherilli in 1954, from samuel P.Wells.
            The name Dilophosaurus derived from Greek means "double-crested lizard". It had two thin, bony crests
            runing from its snout to behind its eye socket.Today Dilophosaurus is known as a bipedal, meat-eater
            dinosaurs.
